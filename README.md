# A pipeline tool for running The Joker on large datasets

[The Joker](https://github.com/adrn/thejoker) is a custom Monte Carlo sampler
for generating posterior samplings over Keplerian orbital parameters for
two-body systems. This package provides a pipeline for running The Joker on
large datasets of homogenous radial velocity data. Early versions of this tool
were used to analyze data from the [APOGEE
surveys](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/apogee-2/), leading to the discovery of
many thousands of binary star systems ([Price-Whelan et al.
2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....156...18P/abstract),
